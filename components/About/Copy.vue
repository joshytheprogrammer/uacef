      <p class="text-slate-500 my-6 text-sm leading-7 md:text-base md:leading-7">UACEF was a unique assignment and a herculean task for the few brethren who caught the vision considering our people were already awashed with mediocrity. But the team did what can be considered to be spiritual expedient by putting down the high points in writing according to Habakkuk 2:2 so as to run with it, those who find it may read and understand it better.</p>

      <p class="text-slate-500 my-6 text-sm leading-7 md:text-base md:leading-7">Late Mr O.C. Emenike and a few of his executives were mandated to format a credible and unique forum that will bring together the elitist christians in our land. They would help to spread the gospel of the kingdom mostly to the upper and lower echelon of the society among the political leadership, opinion moulders, the traditional leadership, the business men's and women in our society, the indigent, the brokenhearted, the widows and the helpless among us.</p>
