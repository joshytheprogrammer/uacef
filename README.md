# United Akokwa Christian Elites Forum (UACEF)

Welcome to the official repository for the United Akokwa Christian Elites Forum (UACEF)!

## About UACEF

The United Akokwa Christian Elites Forum is a non-denominational forum with a noble mission for our clan and generation - spreading the gospel, helping the needy, blessing the poor, and bringing smiles to the faces of our countrymen. For over two decades, we have been diligently working towards fulfilling this mission, and our commitment remains unwavering.

## Annual City Wide Crusade

One of the highlights of our forum is the annual city-wide crusade, which takes place from 26th to 28th December. This event gathers thousands of souls and provides a platform for seasoned ministers to share their wisdom and insights. Some of the esteemed speakers who have graced our podium include:

- Rev. Prof. Moses Madugba (International President, Ministers Prayer Network)
- Rev. Dr. Charles Osueke (Former GS Assemblies of God International)
- Bishop E.O. Ikeakor (Bishop Amichi Diocese Anglican Communion)
- Witness Ken Paul Obieke
- Rev. Dr. Emma Ifeadike
- Evangelist Chinedu Nwejinaka
